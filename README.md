# Task Tracker cli
## Description
This project is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application inspired by the [Task-Tracker](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker) from [Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh).
It is designed to practice fundamental concepts, such as user interaction via the command line and native file system operations, without relying on external libraries.
